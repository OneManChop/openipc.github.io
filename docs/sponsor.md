## Sponsors are welcome

**Let's support opensource cameras together !**

OpenIPC is asking for your help to support development cost and long-term maintenance of what we believe will serve a fundamental role in the advancement of a stable, flexible and most importantly, Open IP Network Camera Framework for users worldwide.

The funds are generally intended to be used to compensate part/full-time maintainers. Most core team members contribute in their spare time and most of the time, personally fund hardware. 
Your financial incentives will help limit their personal costs while also staying up-to-date with the latest hardware.

It is often beneficial to organize meetings, plan events and meet with manufacturers for access to their SDK development kits which are often expensive.

Your contribution will help us advance development proposals forward, and interact with the community on a regular basis.

Recognition for your recurring donations will be permanently published in the Backer/Sponsors section on our GitHub page!

We're committed to open and transparent accounting and are grateful for any support you are able to provide for our efforts so we may advance OpenIPC and our mission towards a sustainable future.

If you have issues getting access or download files, feel free to contact us on our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/openipc).
